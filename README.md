# GOOMPS
> "Get out of my Personal Space."
A mod for Gorilla Tag that hides nearby players

Full credits go to the original mod [GOOMPS](https://github.com/BzzzThe18th/GOOMPS) and the original mod creator [@BzzzThe18th](https://github.com/BzzzThe18th), all I am doing is fixing the mod to work in later versions of Gorilla Tag.

This mod is fully legal and complies with the rules of Gorilla Tag.
